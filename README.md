Apple Vision Pro is a virtual reality headset, which some say is a "heavy headset!" and has a shockingly real feel to it.

Although it is a first-generation product and it is yet to be seen if it can make virtual reality mainstream, it has a tremendous potential to be the bridge to a sci-fi ability.

Stay tuned for more updates on this futuristic tech!

Guys, we've all been waiting for this! It's finally here! The Apple Vision Pro is officially out and you best believe I got my hands on one! This is the future of tech and you're going to love it!

The Vision Pro is a revolutionary piece of hardware. It's so cutting edge that it weighs a whopping 621g! That's almost as heavy as two iPhone 14 Pros! But trust me, it's worth it for all the features it comes with.

It has a whopping 12 cameras in total! Six world-facing cameras on the front and four more cameras inside, with two more at the bottom to track your hand movements. And with resolutions of 4K OLED displays on both eyes, you'll feel like you're living in the matrix!

There are so many features packed into the Vision Pro that it's going to take me a while to cover them all! But just unboxing this beast was an experience in itself. It comes with a power bank, a cushion to ensure no light leaks, a strap, a cleaning cloth and more!

And I can't wait to fully explore it and dive into all the features in my next video but in the meantime, make sure you subscribe so you don't miss out on any of the action!
